Programming Assignment 3 of the Data Science Specialization.

Initially, you have non-tidy data. When you run the "run_analysis.R" script, you will get two tidy datasets. 
The first one joins the train and test data, assigns them their variable names (for features) and label names (for activities), and keeps the mean and standard deviation features. This is a wide dataset.
The second one computes the feature mean at the activity, feature, and subject id level from the first tidy dataset. This second dataset is long.
